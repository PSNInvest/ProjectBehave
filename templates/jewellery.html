<h4>General</h4>
<p>The style of body piercing jewellery is distinct from traditional jewellery worn in the ear lobe such as studs and butterfly designs.
<br>Variations on the barbell and (captive) ring design are those most commonly seen in body piercing because these substantial shapes minimise the risk of embedding, tearing and migration.
<br>
<br>
High quality jewellery is made with smooth surfaces and joins in order to reduce the risk of irritation or of harbouring infection.
Practitioners should ensure that all jewellery used for skin piercings is sterile prior to its use. 
<br>Where jewellery is not purchased pre-sterilized but is sterilized within the premises, the method by which sterilization has been carried out will determine how sterile the jewellery remains.
<br> 
<br>If jewellery is processed and stored properly, it may retain its sterility indefinitely. However, practitioners should be advised to discuss issues such as shelf life with equipment (and packaging) manufacturers.
<br>
<br>
A number of materials are used in skin piercing jewellery and acceptable materials include: Titanium, Niobium, Platinum, Gold – preferably solid gold 14 carat or 18 carat (for ear piercing). 

<br><br>The use of gold higher than 18 carat is not recommended in body piercing as it is too soft and the potential exists for scratching or pitting of the metal which may increase the risk of infection at the piercing site. <br><br>
The use of gold lower than 14 carat is not recommended in body piercing as it tends to be lower in quality and has the potential to contain metallic impurities, which may lead to allergic response in the pierced individual.

<h4>Nickel Directive</h4>
<p>The Nickel Directive was a European Union Directive regulating the use of nickel in jewellery and other products that come into contact
with the skin. The requirements also cover a wide range of other items such as necklaces, bracelets, wristwatch cases, zips and buttons.
Since June 2009 it has been subsumed into the EU REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, legislation and restriction of Chemicals). Nevertheless, the term nickel directive is still used to refer to the restrictions on nickel usage and the prescribed test for quantifying nickel release from products. Jewellery can only be used if the nickel release rate from those parts of these products coming into direct and prolonged contact with the skin is 0.5 micrograms per square centimetre per week, or less. For body piercing jewellery, post assemblies - the part of the jewellery that is inserted into the wound caused by the piercing of the skin, including both the piece that goes through the wound and those parts of the jewellery intended
to hold the piece in and against the wound (earring “back” or balls on the end of a piercing bar or stud) - are prohibited unless their rate
of nickel release is 0.2 micrograms per square centimetre per week, or less.
One problem with these requirements is that they do not apply to jewellery manufactured for export to countries outside the European Union. Where practitioners cannot prove that jewellery being used is in compliance with these requirements, it is advised that use of that jewellery stops until the practitioner can obtain evidence from the manufacturer of its compliance.</p>
