<h4>Licensing & Registration Requirements in London</h4>
The Greater London (General Powers) Act 1981 (GLGPA81) provided London boroughs with a similar adoptive registration system as the LGMPA82 which applied in the rest of England and Wales, together with model bylaws and similar offences relating to infection control. These legal provisions were mainly replaced
in 1991 (see below), however some London boroughs are continuing to use the GLGPA81.<br>
The London Local Authorities Act 1991 (LLAA91), Part II provides a system of licensing for premises offering ‘special treatment’, which is defined as treatment for persons requiring massage, manicure, acupuncture, tattooing, cosmetic piercing, chiropody, light, electric or other special treatment of a like kind or vapour, sauna or other baths. <br> Although not mentioned in this list, semi-permanent skin-colouring is regulated as a treatment of a like kind to tattooing, and electrolysis is regulated as an electrical treatment.
<br>The LLAA91 is adoptive. No model byelaws have been issued, however, the Act allows boroughs to issue a licence on “such terms and conditions and subject to such restrictions as may be specified”. Effectively this means there is no real limitation on what these may cover, but the Act does list nine specific areas, some of which are not related to infection control. 
<br><br>
The London local authorities can also make standard conditions that will be attached to all licences issued, however, there are no standardised conditions across London under the LLAA91. Therefore the requirements can vary between individual London local authorities, however, they all include infection control and other more general safety issues.
<br>
Under the LLAA91 it is the premises that are required to be licensed, not the persons carrying out the treatments. However,some London local authorities will name individual practitioners on the licence. Training requirements for practitioners may be specified in conditions attached to the licence and some London local authorities operate free (but mandatory) registration schemes for practitioners through conditions on the licence.
<br> <br>
<h5>Exemptions within London</h5>
The LLAA91 allows several exemptions from the requirement for a licence:<br>
a) Treatments carried out for no gain or reward are exempt.<br>
b) Doctors registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) are exempt for all treatments.<br>
c) Members of “bona fide bodies of health practitioners” can be exempted where they use their skills in curing or alleviating of bodily diseases or ailments, but this does not include a person whose skills are employed mainly for cosmetic alteration or decorative purposes.<br>
d) Dentists registered with the General Dental Council (GDC) are exempt for acupuncture.<br>
e) Various other exemptions are allowed but they do not extend to skin piercing or skin colouring activities.<br><br>
The licence for the premises is not mandatory as it can be refused on 13 different grounds including, the suitability of the applicant; structural stability of the premises; likely nuisance caused by the business; training of staff; suitability of equipment and fire precautions. 
<br>
When granted it is renewable on an annual basis with the same grounds to refuse the renewal each year. If the licence is not renewed then it ceases to exist.
<br> The licence can be varied at any time, or transferred to another person, although this can be refused.
The local authority must notify the Police and the Fire Authority of each application, and these bodies can make comments that the local authority may consider, and act upon, if they so wish. <br>The consultation requirement is for notification only and the consultees do not have to respond.
<br>Offences include operating a special treatment premises without a licence, or not in accordance with the terms of the licence (a ‘breach of conditions’). The licence can be revoked by the local authority if the licensee is convicted of a breach of conditions. 
<br> Officers authorised by the local authority have powers of entry where they believe an offence may have been committed, and a warrant is not required. 
<br>Penalties on conviction for offences are fines up to Level 4 on the Standard Scale (currently £2500)
