	<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The use of legislation in this area of activity is primarily to ensure that infection control arrangements are adequate and effectively carried out wherever so-called ‘special treatments’ are carried out. 
	<br><br>
‘Special Treatments’ are usually defined as treatments for persons requiring massage, manicure, acupuncture, tattooing, cosmetic piercing, chiropody, light, electric or other special treatment of a like kind or vapour, sauna or other bath.
<br>The primary means of enforcing infection control arrangements is by use of the licensing or registration provisions. These are prescriptive methods with offences and penalties for non- compliance. The licensing and registration provisions are largely concerned with setting requirements for good standards by requiring the maintenance of established hygiene controls in respect of premises, equipment, procedures and practices. However, there
are additional controls contained in primary legislation that do contain provisions for the immediate prohibition of activities or persons or for the closure of premises where risk of infection can be demonstrated.
The legislation relating to tattooing and skin piercing activities, as well as other so-called ‘special treatments’, can therefore be broadly split into two main areas:<br><br>
• Specific controls by registration or licensing of premises and people carrying out the activities, and<br>
• General controls of activities through primary legislation that is not specific to particular activities but applies to all of them.
