	<h4>Age Limits & Consent</h4>
The need for limits on age, and requirements for consent, can be a controversial area because in many circumstances specific requirements have not been made in law. <br> Consent is a complex area of law, and one that is often misunderstood by the general public, and also some skin piercing practitioners.<br><br>

<h5>Tattooing</h5>
The Tattooing of Minors Act 1969 imposes a statutory minimum age of 18 years for
permanent tattooing (except when carried out for medical reasons by a duly qualified medical practitioner or by a person working under their direction). The practitioner has a defence if they can show that they had good reason to believe that the person was over 18 years of age. The consent of a client under 18 is not a defence. The Police enforce this legislation and fines are up to Level 3 on the Standard Scale (currently £1000).

<h5>Other skin piercing activities</h5>
There is no statutory minimum age for any other form of skin piercing activity. Within London, the licensing framework makes it possible for local authorities to state a minimum age for these activities. However, this has not been consistently applied: some boroughs set no age restrictions; some prohibit cosmetic piercing under 18 or 16, and some allow it with parental consent; others allow ‘above the belt’ skin piercing above the ages of 16 or18, and yet others ban all types of genital and nipple piercing.

<h5>Acupuncture and electrolysis</h5>
When carried out properly these do not cause harm to the body, and leave no permanent markings. For this reason they are not likely to raise any concerns over common assault charges, although practitioners should be aware of possible indecent assault complications (see below). Consent should still be obtained before treatment takes place, and in the case of a minor this should be obtained from the parents or legal guardians.

<h5>Ear and nose piercing</h5>
Ear piercing, and in some cultures nose piercing, is generally considered acceptable when carried out on a minor, even below the age of five, provided that a parent or legal guardian gives consent and is present whilst the procedure is carried out.
<br>
Semi-permanent skin-colouring, cosmetic piercing, beading, branding, scarring, cutting and other extreme forms of body modification do cause actual harm and generally leave permanent marks and can result in disfigurement. They can therefore be considered as assaults to the body, and so potentially subject to the legislation concerning assault. This means that the question of age and the client’s informed consent are very important 
<br>
<br>
<h5>Consent</h5>
In the legal proceedings of R v Brown (1994) 1 AC 212, the House of Lords ruled on appeal that consent could not be a defence against sections 20 and 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which deals with common assaults. However, the law also recognises that certain activities that give rise to ‘harm’ are lawful. This includes surgery, tattooing, ear piercing and violent sports. The courts have also held that the law allows children under the age of 18 to consent to cosmetic body piercing provided they are sufficiently mature to understand the nature of the request. This kind of assessment is clearly a subjective matter for the operator who will need to ensure that the client is provided with sufficient information to allow them to proceed in an informed way and without pressure.
Under the Sexual Offences Act 1956, girls and boys under the age of 16 cannot legally give consent to intimate sexual contact under any circumstances, so piercing of nipples and genitalia (for girls) or genitalia (for boys) can be regarded as an assault offence. Evidence that such contact was for sexual gratification would be required in order to constitute an indecent assault. The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 states that certain procedures in respect of female genitals is illegal unless carried out for medical reasons.
The signing of a declaration and providing proof of age should be a fundamental part of the client consultation process and practitioners should always require that the client signs a consent form prior to any work being commenced. However, the consent will only be valid if the customer has been fully informed as to the nature of the process, the likely effect and potential problems involved. An example of a consent form is provided in Appendix 9. However, for practitioners own protection, it is recommended that any consent forms they use are worded with the advice of a solicitor who is familiar with this area of law.
